## Assignment #1
  ### Transitive Closure 
  A relation R on a set X is transitive if, for all x, y, z in X, whenever x R y and y R z then x R z. Examples of transitive relations include the equality relation on any set, the "less than or equal" relation on any linearly ordered set, and the relation "x was born before y" on the set of all people. Symbolically, this can be denoted as: if x < y and y < z then x < z.
  
  ### TODO?
  Create an input and show the output of transitive closure result in div.
